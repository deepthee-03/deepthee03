## 🚀 **Projects in Action**  

### **1. ML-TSE for CO2 | Machine Learning-Based Time Series Models for Effective CO2 Emission Prediction in India**  
- A machine learning-based system designed to predict CO2 emissions in India using time series models, empowering policymakers and researchers to address environmental challenges.  
- Combines statistical models (ARIMA, SARIMAX, Holt-Winters) with deep learning techniques (LSTM), where LSTM emerged as the most accurate model, reducing prediction errors by 90% compared to ARIMA.  
- Processed a 40-year dataset (1980–2019) from CAIT (WRI), addressing missing values and data inconsistencies with advanced preprocessing techniques.  
- Evaluated using nine metrics, including MSE, RMSE, and R2 Score, where LSTM demonstrated superior accuracy in capturing non-linear temporal trends and seasonality.  
- Plans include integrating exogenous variables (e.g., population growth, policy changes), expanding forecasts to multiple sectors/regions, and exploring hybrid models combining LSTM and Transformers for greater accuracy.  
- **Technologies Used:** Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch.  

### **2. ARM-Kp-GED | Association Rule Mining in Klebsiella pneumoniae Using Gene Expression Data**  
- To uncover significant gene associations and their roles in antimicrobial resistance (AMR) by analyzing Klebsiella pneumoniae gene expression data using association rule mining.  
- The dataset was collected from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), consisting of 1,414 genes across 54 samples under various stress conditions and antibiotic exposures.  
- Data preprocessing involved cleaning raw data, normalizing it using the DESeq2 package, and converting gene expression levels into a binary format for compatibility with the Apriori algorithm.  
- The Apriori algorithm was used to identify frequent gene co-expression patterns, generating 418,173 association rules, which were filtered to 59 meaningful rules based on a lift value > 2.  
- Discovered strong associations between genes, such as ompC → cirA and tonB → entF, linked to potential AMR mechanisms.  
- Results were validated using the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD) and STRING database, confirming two antibiotic resistance genes (ompC and tonB) and uncovering significant protein-protein interactions.  
- This study provides insights into the genetic basis of multidrug resistance in Klebsiella pneumoniae, highlighting novel and known gene interactions. It opens pathways for targeted interventions against AMR and contributes to genomic research in bacterial pathogens.  
- **Technologies Used:** Python, DESeq2, STRING, CARD
